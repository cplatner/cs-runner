# cs Runner

Simple command line that can run C# files like the [go](https://golang.org) or
[dotnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet) does.

1. Only the 'run' command works at the moment:

    <pre>
    cs run &lt;file&gt;
    </pre>


2. It does not require a project file of any kind.

3. Only C# files with a single source file can be run.
